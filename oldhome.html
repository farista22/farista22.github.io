			<h1> Why? </h1>
				Contrary to popular belief, a healthy vegan diet does not inhibit performance, but actually improves it. There are several top elite athletes that eat this way not only for a smaller carbon foot print, happier conscience, and ethical reasons, but also because Their inflammation and risk for disease is lowered. Recovery time is cut down greatly. Many bodybuilders even describe it as a "cleaner pump" <br>
				The human body is not made to eat meat. Our digestive tract more resembles an herbivore rather than a carnivore.

				This is because carnivores have a very short digestive tract to quickly expell the meat from the body. However, a herbivore, has a longer digestive tract to break down the great amount of nutrients that come from plants.

				 If an herbivore eats meat, the carcas literally rots inside the intestive, releasing carcinogens and chemicals that make the animal feel sluggish and sickly. Most meat eating humans even get used to this feeling, but once you feel the physical freedom of a vegan diet, your energy will be through the roof!
				 Dont believe me? Ask one of the smartest influential doctors promoting the vegan movement,
